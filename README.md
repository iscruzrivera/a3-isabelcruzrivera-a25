## To-Do List Functionalities
For my project, I decided to implement a simple to-do list. To enter a task, users should input the name of the task, select the priority, and hit enter. Users can delete task entries by clicking "Delete" and can modify the task name/priority by clicking "Modify". I decided to create a derived field of deadline - tasks of Low priority are due in 3 days, tasks of medium priority are due in 2, and tasks of high priority are due in 1.

## HTML Achievements
1. I use an HTML form to get the user input for the task.
2. The result page in on the same page as the input page.
3. The main page does validate
4. There is only one page

## CSS Achievements
1. Everything has CSS styling
2. I use ID, class, and element selectors (e.g., h1, #results, .modal)
3. Google Font "Smooch Sans" was used
4. All CSS styling was done in "main.css"

## Achievements
### Technical
1. Everything is maintained on one page, and as users enter informaiton, it updates in the table below.
2. Existing data entries can be modified.

## Design/UX
1. I interviewed two of my friends: Grace Kidd and Max Gordon.
2. Grace was able to complete all the tasks I asked of her, but did have some questiosn while I was giving instructions. For example, I asked her to add a task and she was wondering what the High/Medium/Low was. Max was able to complete everything no problem.
3. Even though the priority wasn't explicitly labeled, I was surprised that Grace was able to determine what the priority was. Max surprised me with some of the design element suggestions he made.
4. I would add a functionality that allows the user to select their own deadline. Additionally, I would add headers to the creation section for tasks to make it clearer what each category means. Following Max's suggestions, I think it would be good to make the delete button a trashcan and the edit button a pencil so it is more visual.
